- Read through documentation and Warhammer 40k 8th ed rules
- Commit and push uncommited changes to repo
- Roll-back code to the state it was in the previous commit
- Set up repo in Pycharm with virtual environment
- Convert documentation to markdown
- Run some test games while reading through the code
- Tidy up branches

- Start making amends to code, starting with efficiency changes
	- Battlefields as SQL tables
	- Other loaded data as CSV files to be loaded into the SQL DB
	- Update coherency function to increase efficiency
		- Add models to a "checked" list once they have already been compared to all models 
		in the notFound list
		- Verify coherency by checking if the notFound list is empty
	- Update pathfinding for models that are larger than 1x1
	- Use functions, methods and dictionaries to prevent indenting too far

- Consider some design changes
	- Blast ranges for grenades?
		- "Blast" may have to be an ability rather than a weapon type, else weapons like
		light grenades would be OP.
- Consider adding rules for melee/range skills of 6-10
