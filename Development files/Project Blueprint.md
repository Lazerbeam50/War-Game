**Basic story** – No story. The game will feature a selection of missions to play.

**Basic gameplay features** – Three parts to this:
- Turn-based Wargame. Control infantry, vehicles and monsters against an opponent. Game will be multiplayer only.
- Army customiser. Players can choose between a large range of factions, units and options.
- Online P2P. Game will be playable online using either a server-based matchmaker into P2P multiplayer or direct P2P multiplayer.

**Target groups** – Myself and friends but I will share the game with anyone else who is interested.

**Basic Technical specs** – The game will be written in Python 3.6 through Eclipse + PyDev, using Pygame 1.9 for graphics, sound and input and Twisted 18 for client-side and P2P networking and Flask for the server. Gimp 2 will be used for sprite editing along with Microsoft Paint. Pyinstaller be used to export the code into an executable. PythonAnywhere be used to host the server.

**Estimations** – Project should remain open source with occasional spending on graphic sets.

**Core goals** – Build my own take on Warhammer 40k with:

- Quicker games
- Less complexity
- Less fiddlyness (easier to put together an army and play)
- Less randomness
- More automation
